//For Loops - At their most elemetary form they are just creating an number line for us; starting at a number and ending
at a number - these number are represented by a single variable, named i
//for (#1Step start point; #2Step end point; #4Step howtogetthere){
// #3Step what to do
//}
//i = i + 1 same i++



//Create 1 for loop
