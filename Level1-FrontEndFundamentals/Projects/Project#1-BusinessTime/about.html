            Welcome to <span style="color:#C15047;font-weight:bold">Zipper Checker Uppers</span>, your number one
            source

            Founded in 2012 by Angela Ellsworth. <span style="color:#C15047;font-weight:bold">Zipper Checker
                Uppers</span> has
            come a long way from its beginnings getting
            off the plane in Frankfurt. This was when Angela first noticed that her pants seemed really loose. With
            her
            hands full of suitcases and children, Angela realized to her horror that she had undone her pants on the
            plane and hadn't zipped them up again! This is when <span style="color:#C15047;font-weight:bold">Zipper
                Checker Uppers</span> was born.<br><br>
