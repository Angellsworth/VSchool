## Project Requirements  ( 16 Total Story Points )

### Proposal ( 4 Story Points:  Record Story Point 470 )

This part of the project is to help you narrow down your idea, clarify its parts and make it easier to start coding.

The requirements are as follows:
**Done • Paragraph describing your app idea. What are you building? Who is it for?
• An easily describable [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product). Remember you have a limited amount of time to develop this project. What is the minimum you can get done on this project to meet the requirements and get a product in someone's hand?
• [User Stories](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories). What is a user going to do when they go to your site from the time they hit the landing page? What features do they need and which are optional?
• [Wireframe](https://uxmastery.com/wireframing-for-beginners/). What is each page going to look like? What will be the layout, color scheme, etc?
• [Mind Map](https://www.mindmup.com/). What is the structure of your backend and frontend app going to look like? What routes, models, components, actions, and reducers will you need? How will your data be organized?

This project needs to be a full-stack web application. As such, it needs to satisfy the following set of requirements:

• A passed-off proposal Explaining your app

• Uses MongoDB for the database and Mongoose for schema creation and the ODM (Object-Document Mapper)
• Has user authentication using json web tokens, express-jwt, bcrypt, and dotenv.
